For people who are looking to make sustainable choices at the store, life can quickly become difficult. Is this product vegan? Is this brand cruelty-free? A few Google searches solve the problem but this solution quickly goes out of hand as you do it for any new product you encounter.

Naturally aims to solve that, by providing features to give you a quick answer and peace of mind. It uses popular open sources of data, filtering out product data to get just what you need.

Currently, Naturally fetches data from the following sources:
- [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)

Of course, some data may be missing. However, the used sources, such as Open Food Facts, use crowd-sourced data, which allows you to fill in the gaps for the benefit of any user after you.

## Installing

Naturally is still in development, with several important features on the way. It is currently not available on any app store, but you can go to [Releases](https://github.com/cooldruid/naturally/releases), download the APK of the latest version and install it on any Android phone.

## Features

Naturally has the following features available:

- Food scanning: Fetch product data by typing the barcode or scanning it with your camera. You will see an image of the product, easily-visible signs showing whether the food product is vegan or vegetarian as well as the ingredient list to manually review inconclusive ingredients.
